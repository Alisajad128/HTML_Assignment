Python is a general-purpose programming language.
 That means it was designed and developed to write software for a wide variety of disciplines.
 Python has been used to write applications to solve problems in biology, chemistry, financial analysis,
 numerical analysis, robotics, and many other fields. It is also widely used as a scripting language for
 use by computer administrators, who use it to capture and replay sequences of computer commands.
